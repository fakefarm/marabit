form habits together.

## Issues
### Git issues
- trying to manage git from one user, on two computers
- cloned repo onto second computer, but the rails-engine branch didn't show. Had trouble pulling it down, and pushing it. Now the pushed branch is a different name. (remotes/origin/rails-engine)

### Trouble with rails views:
  Can't seem to get engine views to be found.

## Routes
Routes uses the boot_inquirere to auto load any apps. It also provides a cool way to work on specific apps.
There are 4 parts.
- lib/boot_inquirer
- appliction.rb
- gemfile
- routes
